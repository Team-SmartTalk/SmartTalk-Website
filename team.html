          <b>Role:</b> Team Leader
        <br>
          <b>Relevant Coursework:</b> CS345, CS399, CS212, CS386
        <br>
          <b>Skills:</b>
        <br>
          <u>Java</u>: I use Java very frequently for developing mobile applications and algorithms. I am very familiar with this language and its syntax.
        <br>
          <u>Flutter and Kotlin</u>: I’ve used Kotlin to develop mobile apps
          for CS 399. I am pretty familiar with it so I could use it once again
          for this project. I have also used Flutter, but not as much.
        <br>
          <u>Python</u>: I am very comfortable with Python and its syntax.
          I am familiar with some Python server libraries for backend web
          development too, but I would love to learn more.
        <br>
          <u>JavaScript, HTML5,/CSS</u>:
          This is the standard tech stack for web development.
          These were the first languages/tools I learned as a software developer!
        <br>
          <u>SQL</u>: I have some knowledge of how to format SQL queries to use databases.
        <br>
          <b>Other Interests:</b>
            I love to be outdoors! I go hiking quite often and try to keep active!
            I came to NAU and Flagstaff for the climate and green environment!
            I am also a huge animal lover, so I loved my work with PetSmart!
            I choose this project as I have used language learning apps in the
            past to learn Spanish. I know how they work and, most importantly,
            how to improve upon them.

          <b>Hometown:</b> NanTong, China
        <br>
          <b>Role:</b> Release Manager
        <br>
          <b>Relevant Coursework:</b> CS399, CS345, CS386
        <br>
          <b>Skills:</b>
        <br>
          <u>Mobile Application Development</u>:
          I learned CS399  before and know some basic knowledge about mobile
          application development. Besides, I developed a simple
          take out application with my friends in CS386 so I know
          the progress of how to develop an app.
        <br>
          <u>Learning</u>: During CS386,I found that there are
          many things that I have never set foot in so I think it is very
          important to be good at learning new content. In future
          development, it must have some new things we need to learn
          and I'm ready to do that for any time.
        <br>
          <b>Other Interests:</b>
            I am very interested in the development of mobile applications
            because I can run my development results on my own
            mobile phone. After mastering enough knowledge,
            I can even write some plug-ins to make my phone unique,
            which is very cool. Now I am working hard in this
            direction, and developing a fully functional app with
            team members will greatly enhance my ability. I am
            willing to learn any new knowledge to help my team develop this app.

        <br>
          <b>Skills:</b>
        <br>
          <u>Web Development</u>: I have learned this concept in CS 212 and CS 312.
            By developing web applications, I have found it interesting to
            know about web servers and how to create a website from scratch
            through HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        <br>
          <u>Teamwork</u>: On my career path of pursuing my degree
            in computer science, I have learned it is important to not only be
            a people person but to listen other people's ideas
        <br>
          <u>Technical Writing</u>: Over the years of learning how to get comfortable
            with writing I have  improved those skills-CS 386 and ENG 302W.
            By taking these courses I feel extremely comfortable and I can
            write any professional document.
        <br>
          <b>Other Interests:</b>
            Throughout my experience at NAU I have become very passionate
            about mobile and web development. By taking all the courses that
            have been provided to me, I would like to use everything I have
            learned to create a product that can be useful. Also to keep
            learning and developing new skills to become a better developer
            as well a better person.

          <b>Relevant Coursework:</b> CS399, CS499, CS345, CS386
        <br>
          <b>Skills:</b>
        <br>
          <u>C</u>: I am very familiar with this language due to an OS simulation
          project in CS 480, with some focus on POSIX threads.
        <br>
          <u>Flutter and Kotlin</u>: I used Flutter during CS 499, and Kotlin during
          CS 399. In both classes, I have made a mobile application and became
          familiar with each language.
        <br>
          <u>Language</u>: Learning to understand spoken Japanese and Tagalog has
          helped me become better at recognizing tone and pitch, as well as
          allowing me to have a better understanding of different intonations
          and pronunciation.
        <br>
          <b>Other Interests:</b>
            I like to explore different types of
            interdisciplinary concepts, such as learning languages through
            applications or implementing programs in robots. I think that using
            different skills that are normally separated together is an important
            skill and can open up a number of possibilities.
            Outside of the academic realm, I enjoy practicing martial arts,
            playing musical instruments, and making model kits.
